# starcraft2-clever-bot

IDEAS: 
- 3 minute stalker rush https://lotv.spawningtool.com/build/163562/ 🧀
- past 3 minutes ideas:
   - defense
   - expansion
   - resource gathering methodologies
   - abilities in combat
   - research (upgrades)
   - critical scenerios (voidrays wait when there are no buildings)
   - use case for RL? (or supervised)
   - scouting with probes for info (should be useful for RL)

- Useful paper we could take inspiration from: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1724-z#MOESM2
   - they have replay data which we could use for supervised learning


TODO: 
- implement the cheese build
- find use case for RL (without implementing) 
- combat and abilities upgrades for void ray rush
